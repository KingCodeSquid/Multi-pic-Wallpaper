Please edit "config.json" to match your needs.
Only change "secondsUntilChange", "shuffledOrder" and "PATH" (if needed).


Meanings
--------------

- "secondsUntilChange" is how much time you want the program to wait before changing wallpapers

- "shuffledOrder" determines if you want the wallpaper images to be shuffled

- "PATH" is the path where the files are stored.


Rules
--------------


**DO NOT EDIT SPI_SET_WALLPAPER IN "config.json"!! IF CHANGED THE PROGRAM MIGHT NOT WORK!!**


If you set shuffeledOrder to 0 or "no", you must name the files by order as numbers from 1 up. Example: 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc. You must name them like that or they will not work.


Only set "PATH" to where you stored the pictures. If you put your pictures in "Put your pictures in here", than **DO NOT** change the "PATH" variable.


How to run
--------------

If you downloaded the python version, to run:

(You need python 3 to continue)

Open the cmd / command prompt in location of the python file (main.py)

You can do that by doing cd location/of/the/python/file

Once in the location write: pythonw "main.py"

Done! You can now close the commmand prompt

(to close it end the "python" task in your task manager)
